					<h2>About Course</h2>
					<p style="padding-left:5px;">The Certificate in Computer Applications is a practical course whose main aim is to provide opportunity for interested candidates to develop Information and Communications Technology (ICT) skills that are becoming essential in every sector of our economy.<br>
